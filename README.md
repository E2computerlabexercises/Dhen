      <h2>Article: Plagiarism</h2>
      <p>Plagiarism is the act of copying someone else's work without proper credit. It is a serious offense and can result in severe consequences globallyPlagiarism defined
Plagiarism involves the act of using others’ work and trying to pass it off as your own original work. Plagiarism can include using someone else’s words or ideas in order to submit an assignment or complete a task and involves not properly documenting where the information was obtained. Essentially, plagiarism is stealing another person’s work or ideas. It can occur intentionally and unintentionally.

When plagiarism occurs intentionally, the offender is aware that he or she will use an author’s work and reproduce it as an original work. As explained in the introduction, the student is up late and notices a paper on the Internet that is exactly what he or she needs. The student decides to download the paper from the Internet and submit it as his or her original work. Individuals who intentionally plagiarize will use words verbatim or paraphrased words of another person and document the work as their own.

When plagiarism occurs unintentionally, the offender usually has some documentation in the work from the author that could be cited (documented with a citation) incorrectly. There is documentation of the original work present but a few errors. The source can be traced and there is no malicious intent to avoid citing the author’s work.

For example, “Lee (2010) commented that adult learners can take preparatory steps to prepare for college.” The student might forget to place the information about the author on the reference page, or there might be no quotation marks if this was a direct quotation, or page or paragraph numbers (from a website). This could be considered unintentional plagiarism. Usually, the instructor will notate in the document what was missing and that is the extent of the issue in this case..</p>
